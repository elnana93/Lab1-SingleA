# Lab1-SingleA

The goal of this lab is to practice team-based Git workflows while building a simple, functional Python console application. Emphasis is placed on branching discipline, collaboration, and merge integration, not application complexity.


Notes:
git clone <repo-url>
git checkout -b feature/elnana93-function
git add .
git commit -m "Add my function"
git push -u origin feature/elmoge-function
